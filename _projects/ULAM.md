The objective of the current proposal is to grow, investigate and use novel three-dimensional carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanowalls (CNWs), on a transparent substrate, for sensing applications and environmental remediation.

Selected works
{% cite de2022diamondized %}  introduces a significant advance in electrocatalysis by studying the use of 3D-diamondized carbon nanoarchitectures for the electrosynthesis of sulfate-based oxidizing species. This builds on prior work investigating the material's ability to enhance charge transfer and degrade organics, emonstrating efficient SO4⋅−​ ion-radical production, surpassing conventional BDD surfaces. 
{% cite pierpaoli2022novel %} details a novel and simplified fabrication method for creating metal-free, hierarchically-porous electrodes (\text{HiDiPAN}) for electrochemical sensing. The innovation lies in using a simultaneous carbonization and surface functionalization process via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which drastically reduces manufacturing time and yields an 18-fold increase in acetaminophen detection sensitivity compared to conventional treatment.
{% cite pierpaoli2020enhanced %} focuses on modifying carbon nanostructures for photocatalysis, reporting the creation of a transparent \text{B-CNWs/TiO}_{2} heterostructure for enhanced nitrogen oxide (NOx​) removal. This structure is novel because it is the first study where TiO2​ was deposited via sol-gel onto transparent boron-doped carbon nanowalls, leveraging the B-CNW layer to affect TiO2​ crystallinity and promote charge separation efficiently.
{% cite pierpaoli2023engineering %} describes the development of a hybrid 3D/2D carbon nanoarchitectured electrode (\text{BDD/BCNW}) assessed for the electrochemical oxidation of recalcitrant landfill leachate. This hybrid system improved upon standard BDD electrodes by utilizing the maze-like morphology of the BCNWs to enhance COD removal efficiency and achieve a higher current exchange density
{% cite pierpaoli2021simultaneous %} presents a simultaneous opto-electrochemical monitoring of carbamazepine (CBZ) and its electro-oxidation by-products, using a novel transparent electrode (BDD/BCNW on quartz). Combining differential pulse voltammetry with UV–visible spectroscopy, the method achieved a low detection limit of 3.6 µM. The electrode’s transparency enabled optimal transmission measurements, crucial due to strong adsorption of CBZ and its by-products on the surface.
