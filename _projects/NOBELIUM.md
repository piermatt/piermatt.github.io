The project focus on the development of doped and/or functionalized carbon nanostructured electrodes for the electrochemical detection of biomarkers, pharmaceuticals, and polyfluorinated alkyl substances in water and biofluids.

Selected works:
{% cite pierpaoli2023engineering %} presents an innovative molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) sensor integrated with a diamond-rich carbon nano-architecture, specifically designed for sensitive and selective detection of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), a persistent water pollutant. This work emphasizes environmental monitoring with high structural control and stability. {% cite pierpaoli2022impedimetric %}  introduces a cost-effective impedimetric sensor based on boron-doped carbon nanowalls (BCNW), functionalized with a 1,8-diazafluoren-9-one/titanium dioxide (DFO/TiO₂) layer, enabling the fast quantification of α-amino acids like glycine—key biomarkers in clinical diagnostics. {% cite pkoterwa2023discriminating %} departs from conventional signal processing by proposing Multiparametric Impedance Discriminant Analysis (MIDA), applied to a gold nanocube (AuNC)-modified glassy carbon electrode for label-free, real-time detection of Escherichia coli in human urine. It pioneers the direct use of raw impedance data, bypassing traditional equivalent circuit modeling.
