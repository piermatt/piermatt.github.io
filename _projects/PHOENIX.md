The goal of the project is to architect novel carbon heterostructures, by an innovative hybrid synthesis method, involving additive manufactury and a plasma-based functionalization, for highly efficient electrodes able to degrade persistent organic pollutants into harmless ones. Moreover, secondary waste materials, such as sewage sludge ash and coal fly ash, will be employed as a valuable filler and catalysts for the electrode synthesis process, by incorporating them into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) matrices through a hybrid synthesis method.

    The project involves CVD simulation, synthesis and application of tailored electrodes for the degradation on persistent organic pollutants.

The research consists of four main tasks: firstly, the electrode shape will be designed and optimized using
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Secondly, by using a novel approach, combining additive
manufacturing with a controlled phase-inversion method and chemical vapour deposition, the electrodes will
be manufactured. Moreover, for the first time, secondary waste materials will be used for electrode synthesis,
to divert them from landfills, in a circular economy vision. Thirdly, the novel architecture materials will be
characterized by different techniques. Fourthly, the electrodes will be tested to degrade POPs. In particular,
different tools will be used to understand how to optimize all the material features to better tailor the desired
process. Multivariate data analysis will be employed for structure-property relationship mining. CFD
simulation will be also employed to support the experimental results. Process parameters will be optimized by
a systematic application of experimental design (DOE) using the Taguchi approach.
Expected results will include the development of a novel synthesis method and a set of tools to design more
effective and efficient carbon-based electrodes for the degradation of emerging pollutants. This project will be
beneficial to fundamental science in deeply understanding the relationship between electrode morphology,
composition and catalysed reactions. Meanwhile, the applications of hierarchically porous carbon electrodes
found application also in other tremendously important and topical sectors, such as energy storage and
conversion and desalination devices.
